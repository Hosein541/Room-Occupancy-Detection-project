## Project Overview
The Occupancy Prediction project aims to predict whether a room is occupied or not based on the data collected from various sensors. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 7 attributes, namely date, temperature, humidity, light, CO2, humidity ratio, and occupancy.

### Summary and Conclusion

In this project, I focused on predicting room occupancy using various data preprocessing techniques and a machine learning model. The steps and methodologies employed are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:
   - Timestamp Splitting: The original column containing year, month, day, hour, and minute was split into two separate columns: one for day and another for hour.
   - Data Simplification: The day column was adjusted to store only the day value, and the hour column to store only the hour value.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Appropriate visualizations were created to explore and understand the data patterns and relationships. These visualizations provided significant insights into the data.

3. Data Standardization:
   - Data standardization was performed to normalize the features, ensuring consistency and enhancing model performance.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - A Random Forest model was trained on the processed dataset, achieving a remarkably high accuracy of 99%.

These steps ensured a comprehensive analysis and model training process, leading to a highly accurate prediction model for room occupancy detection.
